### Tech Stack
- Deno + oak + dejs\
  Deno is very fun to build with when paired with Oak, it's very much like a NodeJs + Express type server. But to be honest, almost better in every way.
  
- HTMX\
  HTMX is very very interesting and unique to work with. The learning curve is high but it reminds me somewhat of Alpine.js. My simple portfolio only requires simple actions so HTMX is very much perfect for this.

- TailwindCSS\
  Admittedly, I am very lazy at writing raw CSS. So Tailwind is a no brainer for me. It is fast , very easy, and nice to work with.
  
- NginX\
  NginX is the reverse proxy of my server. Also added HTTPS functionality with Certbot.
  
- Hostinger VPS\
  Very friendly dashboard for new users like me who is new to virtual private servers. Low cost too! It also came with a free domain name (which is https://estella-dev.cloud)
